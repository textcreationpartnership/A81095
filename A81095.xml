         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ſacred Majeſty, this ſmall Book (which we have compiled for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of your devout children) as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and permanent Teſtimonie and Profeſſion of our being entirely vow'd and addicted to your ſons, and your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſervice; And we are thereto induced by much more forcible reaſons, than ſuch as are wont to move men to make an Oblation of their works, to the worthy's of this world: For firſt, you (O Glorious Virgin!) are the greateſt Princeſs of the whol univerſs, and can therefore repay our endeavours with more reall rewards than the richeſt earthly Monarch can confer upon his Clients. Moreover, you are meek, mild, and mercifull, and therefore will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daign the meaneſt offerings of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted and well meaning Vaſſalls: Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, The particular and perſonall Favours we have already receiv'd, by your powerfull patronage, prayers, and protection; (<hi>Favours,</hi> which can be by no one deny'd without a ſpice of infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor diſguiſed without doing you an apparent injury, nor ſuppreſs'd without our expreſs ingratitude) give us a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind of hopefull confidence, that (according to your wonted goodneſs and clemency) you will not now reject us,
<pb facs="tcp:133233:3"/> coming before you with theſe preſents, (ſuch as they are,) in our hands; who have ſo piouſly heretofore help'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved us, in our moſt urgent and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing neceſſities: And finally, This Book it ſelf <hi>(O Soveraign Queen-Mother!)</hi> ſtands in need of your ſpeciall favour, to render it fruitfull to its Readers; For whoſoever will make right uſe thereof, muſt have ſimple and Dove-like eyes, ayming only at Heaven; ſingle and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſſed Hearts, pretending no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Piety; humble and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſpirits, captivated to Faith's my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries; docible, diligent, and devout ſouls, willing to learn how they may rayſe their thoughts to celeſtiall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, whilſt their tongues run over their common prayers and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; briefly, earneſt and ardent deſires to imitate your Sons, and your vertues, and to expreſs in their lives, manners, and converſations, what they reſent and reſolve in their meditations: All which neceſſary capacities, you <hi>(O ſingularly perfect and powerfull Virgin!)</hi> can principally obtain for them; and which we beſeech you, <hi>(O moſt compaſſionate Mother!)</hi> to procure for us, and for all the devout children of your ſacred <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:133233:4"/> that ſo our daily Prayers may not be without fervent affections, nor our affections without efficacious works, nor our works without the ſweet fruits of Eternall life.</p>
            <p>We pretend not here <hi>(O moſt worthy Mother of the Word Eternall and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate!)</hi> to make a Panegyrick of your prayſes, which were a deſign far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our forces; and we willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that our wings are too weak to rayſe us up to this Sphere of wonders; that our dim eyes want ſtrength to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the radiant ſplendor of this divin Sun; that we ſhould loſe our ſelv's in this large Ocean of your Mervails; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that by our over-near approaching to ſo great a Majeſty, we ſhould infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be oppreſt by your Glory: But ſhould we undertake ſo impoſſible a task, and adventure upon ſo raſh an enterpriſe; have we not ſumm'd up all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of your glory, by ſtyling you <hi>Gods worthy Mother?</hi> Surely to be <hi>Mother of the Soveraign Deity,</hi> is a Supream Dignity, (ſince 'tis the baſis, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work and foundation of all imaginable height, holineſs, and happineſs, that can befall a creature) but yet 'tis incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably more perfection to deſerve this dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb facs="tcp:133233:4"/> than to poſſeſs it; ſo that had you, <hi>(O moſt holy Virgin Mother!)</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd it without having it, you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd much greater, than by having it without deſerving it: For your merit was not ſo ſtrictly ty'd to your Mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nor your Dignity to your deſert, as that they might not have ſeparatedly ſubſisted; ſince the Divin Majeſty might have made choyce of ſome other leſs perfect Woman than your ſelf, for his Mother; as alſo he could have conferr'd on you this plenitude of Grace, wherby you acquired your worth without obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himſelf to make you h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s Mother: whence it moſt evidently follows, that deſerving to become Gods Mother, though you had not been ſo, is to you a greater honour and dignity, than it had been to another to be ſo, without having deſerv'd it: And though the greateſt Gratification, which God can bestow upon a ſimple creature, is to make it his Mother, yet this ſingly conſidered, is only an Act of pure Gratification; whereas your Sanctity <hi>(O Sacred Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin!)</hi> had it not been joyn'd to your Maternity, would nevertheleſs have rais'd you to that prime place you now poſſeſs in your Creators favour, and
<pb facs="tcp:133233:5"/> rendred you worthy of that inexplicable glory, you ſhall there enjoy in heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other Creatures for all future Eternity. Wherefore, if to ſtyle you <hi>Gods Mother,</hi> is to ſay, you can be no higher in dignity, without being God himſelf; ſurely to entitle you <hi>Gods worthy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> is to ſay, you are by your merit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all that is not the Divin Majeſty; ſince 'tis to avouch, That the deſert of your Perſon agrees with the greatneſs of your Prerogative; and that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your merit, correſponds to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of your Maternity; which is ſo eminent a <hi>Dignity,</hi> that the Almighty by his abſolute power, can exalt no purely crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We further aſſert, (being ſupported by S. <hi>John Damaſcens [orat. 1. de Nativit. B. M.]</hi> and <hi>S. Ildephonſu's [lib. de Virgin: &amp; parturitione B.

            <p>Yet ſurely could this Book have been conveniently dedicated to any other than the Queen of Heaven (whoſe honour is its chief aym and intention) it muſt neceſſarily have had recourſe unto your ſelf under whoſe wings it received its birth, growth, and accompliſhment: In acknowledgment whereof, and the many ſignall favours, you have charitably conferr'd upon us, and upon this holy Confrater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the ſacred <hi>Roſary,</hi> we conceiv'd our ſelv's bound to give this publick teſtimony of our ſincere

            <p>Nor are we only <hi>Children</hi> of this bleſſed <hi>Mother,</hi> as being the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Brethren</hi> of her divin <hi>Son,</hi> but moreover as being the <hi>Children of her Child,</hi> by whom we are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated to a ſpirituall life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus, thus,</hi> She is alſo our <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ſince ſhe is Mother to him, by whoſe death we are all re-born to the Life of Grace; <hi>Thus</hi> we are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy <hi>Mary</hi>'s Children, ſince we are the fruits of the <hi>Bleſſed fruit of her womb JESUS.</hi> She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed brought forth, but One only <hi>Son,</hi> but by that One, She begot All them who are by him regenerated; and whoſoever derive from <hi>Jeſus</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now, if the ſacred Virgin (as hath been plainly deduced and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) is the <hi>common Parent</hi> of all Chriſtians, both in quality of their being her <hi>Sons Brethren,</hi> adopted and choſen by his Father; and alſo in quality of their being her <hi>Sons children,</hi> regenerated and reſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by his Death: How much more ſingularly is ſhe <hi>their Mother,</hi> who make it their profeſſion to render unto her a particular honour and homage, and to receive her for their ſpeciall Protectrice and Patroneſs.

               <p>A <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> not directly tending to the Reformation of your Lives, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and Converſations, (which were a deſign in me as preſumptuous, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, a matter as far above my Sphear, as beyond my Ability; A task, which our worthy Dean painfully and carefully performs, to our great comfort and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, in his pious Exerciſes and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.) But a <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> ayming at theſe two ends; To declare, <hi>what</hi> the <hi>Roſary</hi> is, And <hi>what it is</hi> to be of the <hi>Roſary:</hi> To deſcribe the <hi>Dignity</hi> of this our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternity, and the <hi>Duty</hi> of us, who are aſcribed into this holy Society, to ſhew you how <hi>fitly</hi> it is by us embraced, and how faithfully we ought to behave our ſelves in it.</p>
               <p>O Sacred Spirit, by whoſe Conduct our pious Predeceſſors laid the happy foundation of this moſt renowned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternity, inſpire my underſtanding to conceive ſomething worthy ſo high a Subject; Enable my tongue to ſpeak ſomething beſeeming the bleſſed Virgins prayſes; Direct my Pen, to couch ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for her devout Childrens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,

               <p>Man being by nature a <hi>Sociable Creature,</hi> is inclined by the principles of his Eſſence, by the temper of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, by the violence of his originall diſpoſition, to ſeek out ſome Conſorts and Companions of his own kind and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the end he may ſolace himſelf in their Society, Conduct his lives courſe by their Counſell, and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with them his affairs and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

               <p>God the Soveraign Creator of all things, who ingrav'd this powerfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of <hi>Society</hi> in mans Soul, as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition connaturall to his life and being.

And therefore he hath from time to time excited pious people to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble themſelves together (for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming of one anothers Zeal, Fervour, and devotion, for their mutuall aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and conſolation, for the increaſe of each others merit and vertue) <hi>To live ſoberly, piouſly, juſtly,</hi> under the diſcreet Laws, Rules, and Ordinances, of one common Society, Congregation, Confraternity.</p>
               <p>And ſurely, our bleſſed <hi>Redeemer</hi> himſelf, (to begin at the fountain head of all Sanctity, the exemplary pattern of all Perfection,) deſcending from Heaven to accompliſh on Earth the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred deſign, which he decreed from all Eternitie, (as if this point had been one of the Prime and principall projects of his Incarnation;) ſeems to aym

This was his Life, his Preaching, his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, to put down Schiſmes, Diviſions, Partialities, and to Imprint in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians hearts, the love of Concord, and the Honour of a happy Confraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For what is more frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated in the Sacred <hi>Goſpells,</hi> in the <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> Decrees, Constitutions of the Apoſtles, in the whol <hi>Volumes</hi> of the holy Bible, than Peace, Charity, Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity?

In obedience to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, we find regiſtred in holy Writ, that the firſt Chriſtians were ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly linked together in holy love and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <hi>as their whol multitude ſeemed

               <p>Theſe worthy Examples (I ſay) have ſince moved many generous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, (Fervent in Gods love, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted

Theſe are the practiſes, the profits, the pleaſures of pious Confraternities, where Love is in its perfection, Concord in her throne, Friendſhip in its purity, Sanctity in its excellency; and therefore ſafety, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, in their trueſt height and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

               <p>And all theſe profits, pleaſures, and prerogatives, belong as properly to your happy ſtate and condition, (O devout children of the <hi>Roſary!</hi>) as to any other ſecular Sodality or Confraternity what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p>For though all well ordered Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and Societies, marching under the Enſigns of Chriſtianity, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of by the Church Catholique, (the onely Royall ſeat of true Faith, Religion, and Devotion,) are highly praiſe-worthy, and exceedingly pleaſing to the divin Majeſty: (ſince, though their Lawes are different, their ways divers, their devotions diſtinct; <hi>Yet</hi> they aym all at the ſame end, ſteer

               <p>And what marvell is it, if whol mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of faithfull <hi>children</hi> have floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to the protection of ſuch a <hi>Mother?</hi> What wonder, that ſo many worthy Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies have deſired to ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under her ſacred wings, in hope to ſail ſecurely over the dangerous Sea of this lives pilgrimage, by her power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tutelage and direction?</p>

               <p>This greatneſs therefore, this glory, this excellency of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is the cauſe of ſo many holy Confraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties erected in her honour; whereof <hi>ſome</hi> fixing upon the <hi>myſteries of her life,</hi> have made choyce of the Annunciation, or the Conception, or the Nativity, or the Purification, or ſome other myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for their particular Motto and name of their pious Confraternities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Others</hi> obſerving the places, which ſhe hath been pleaſed to make famous by her frequent miracles, have entitled their devout Societies from <hi>Loretto</hi> in Italie, from <hi>Mount-Serrat</hi> in Spain, from <hi>Lieſſe</hi> in France, from <hi>Hall</hi> and <hi>Sichem</hi> in Flanders.</p>

               <p>To diſcourſe here of <hi>all</hi> theſe devout <hi>Confraternities</hi> erected in her honour, and dedicated to her ſervice, were as endleſs a project in it ſelf, as uſeleſs to my preſent deſign and purpoſe; and therefore contenting my ſelf to have given you theſe generall notions, names, and prayſes of the moſt eminent and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Orders, Sodalities, and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, I ſhall confine the reſidue of my diſcourſe, to declare <hi>that</hi> onely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternity, which we our ſelves have happily made choyce of; I mean the Arch-Confraternity of the ſacred <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> which contains all the other So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, under its generall name and title, and communicates it ſelf to their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Subdiviſions, as the great Ocean (the generall Magazin of waters) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges it ſelf into many Sea-armes, creeks, and boſomes.</p>

               <p>Is there any one amongſt you afflicted in mind, perplexed in ſpirit, over-tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized by your paſſions, overſwayed by your ſenſuality, apprehenſive of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious enemies, fearfull of threatned tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, tribulations, perſecutions?

               <p>Finally, in all dangers, difficulties, diſtreſſes, think upon the <hi>Mother of Power,</hi> call upon the <hi>Mother of Power:</hi> let her not depart from your mouth, let her not depart from your heart, and that you may obtain relief by her inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, ſwerve not from the example of her converſation: following her, you ſtray not, calling upon her, you deſpair not, thinking on her, you err not: ſhe holding, you fall not, ſhe protecting, you fear not, ſhe guiding, you faint not.</p>
               <p>How properly then (O children of <hi>Mary!</hi>) do we entitle our Mother <hi>Powerfull,</hi> ſince (ſays our learned and devout Doctor <hi>Damian</hi>) the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath ſo highly priviledg'd her with all <hi>Power</hi> in Heaven and Earth, in ſo much as ſhe makes her addreſſes to the ſacred Altar of our reconciliation (<hi>non ſolum rogans, ſed etiam imperans, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina, non ancilla:</hi> Not onely entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but alſo commanding, as a Miſtris, not a handmaid; wherefore I conclude

               <p>And now returning to the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my intended purpoſe: Though the generall devotion of all faithfull Chriſtians towards the ſacred Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> is as ancient as our faith and Chriſtianity themſelves, (ſhe being conſtituted the Churches Mother, by the bequeſt of her bleſſed Son, when he uttered theſe words to <hi>St. John</hi> (as his last will and teſtament) on the Croſs, <hi>Son Behold thy Mother;</hi> Nor did ever yet any true Catholique, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:133233:50"/> and in good ſtate, whereof grace is the root and foundation) hath a title, and may claim a ſhare in all the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall goods, and conſequently in all the treaſures of merits and good works heaped up from the Worlds firſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigin to this preſent, and which ſhall be laid up in the Churches Store-Houſe, till the Worlds Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Creed</hi> teacheth us this truth, wherein we profeſs to believe the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints,</hi> that is, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a communication of merits, between them who are happily lodged in Heaven, and them who (living upon Earth, and lying in Purgatory) hope to follow after.</p>
               <p>We believe that whatſoever the greateſt Saints have done, merited, obtained; what the ancient <hi>Patriarks</hi> by propagating Gods honour, putting down idolatry; what the <hi>Prophets</hi> by preaching Gods Judgments, proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming open Warr againſt all impiety; what the glorious <hi>Apoſtles</hi> by planting the Faith, publiſhing the Goſpel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the World; what the invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Martyrs,</hi> by their endured tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, perſecutions, deaths; what the holy

                  <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> by the couragious carriage of their croſſes, chastiſements of their fleſh, mortifications of their ſenſuality; what the good <hi>Hermits, Anchorites, Monks,</hi> in their Solitudes, Cells, and Cloyſters; what the learned, zealous, eloquent <hi>Doctors,</hi> by their writings, preachings, teachings; what the chaſt <hi>Virgins</hi> and <hi>Widows,</hi> by the inviolable preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their purity; Finally, whatſoever the pious people in their <hi>ſecular</hi> calling, or any <hi>perſons</hi> under each Pole of the World, and in the four corners of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, have profited in good works, in godly actions, in vertuous exerciſes: all this is communicable to each one of the Catholique Churches members; all is to them proportionably imparted and diſtributed. <hi>I am partaker</hi> (ſings joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the Royall Pſalmiſt,) <hi>with all them who fear you, and faithfully fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your Laws and Ordinances.</hi> All ſuch as live Chriſtianly, carefully, devoutly; all ſuch as practiſe works of piety, make progreſs in vertue, march up the degrees of perfection and ſanctity; labour for me, profit me, lay up treaſures for me: we are all fellow members un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one head, we all make up one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon purſe amongſt us, we all aim at the

               <p>Now beſides this <hi>generall</hi> communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſpirituall goods and merits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all faithfull Chriſtians, (the ſtock whereof is in the Churches hands and ſtore-houſe) there is <hi>another bank</hi> in the bodyes of Confraternities common to them alone who are of that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar familie and communitie, and from whence all the influences of graces and bleſſings, which Heaven imparts to this whol body, inflow into each one of its members. And to instance this alſo in ſome particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> what an immenſe profit is it, to have a part in all the zealous prayers, meditations, acts of charity, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Vertu and Piety, performed in a whol Confraternity?

               <p>And what an incredible force (judg yee, devout Roſarists!) muſt this needs
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:133233:52"/> add to our petitions? How can a juſt demand, preſented by ſo many pious Souls, ſent up to Heaven by ſo many humble hearts, pronounced by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny devout tongues, ſuffer a repulſe? If our Creator, though moſt highly incenſed and irritated by the wicked and malicious <hi>Sodomites;</hi> yet merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed to pardon all their enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous impieties, might there have been found amongſt them only <hi>ten juſt Men,</hi> to joyn in prayer with holy <hi>Abraham</hi> for their delivery; May we not (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſumption) perſwade our ſelves, that the prayers of ſo many good Souls, (whereof this Sacred Confraternitie is compoſed) may have great power to move our Maker, (when he is juſtly angry with us for our offences, ingratitude, diſloyalty,) to pitty and pardon us, and to reverſe the ſentence of our deſerved puniſhment and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? Surely united forces, (you know) are far more prevalent than when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; many Torches give a greater luſter, many fires affoard a fiercer heat, many men remove a heavier weight, and in all caſes whatſoever, that which <hi>one alone</hi> is unable to attain, uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to effect, unworthy to deſerve, a

                  <hi>multitude</hi> conſpiring together in the ſame end and intention, may hope to at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chieve and compaſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> what an ineſtimable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is it to have a ſhare of merit in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny divin Sacrifices of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated yearly, monthly, weekly, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (to Gods glory, to his Mothers ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to his Saints prayſes, to the Solace of the living, to the Succour of the dead:) both at this ſacred and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg'd Altar of our bleſſed Mother of <hi>Power,</hi> And whereſoever, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World this Arch-Confraternitie of the <hi>Roſary</hi> is erected and eſtabliſhed?</p>
               <p>If one only <hi>Maſſe,</hi> the lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of what paſſed upon Mount-Calvary, the higheſt act of Religion, the authenticall memoriall of the great ſacrifice of the Croſs, is capable (ſays our Venerable Father <hi>Bede</hi>) to add glory to God, joy to the Angels and Saints, grace to the just, pardon to Sinners, comfort to the living, help to the Souls in Purgatory; what good, what grace, what advantage may you here expect, where ſo many <hi>Maſſes</hi> are daily celebrated for the forenamed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, whereof each member parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates?</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:133233:53"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> what a vaſt treaſure of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences,</hi> Pardons, Jubilies (given and granted by the prime Paſtours of the Church, the generall diſpencers of divin bleſſings, the univerſall Stewards of celeſtiall riches) are annexed to this our holy Confraternity? <hi>Indulgences,</hi> which no Catholique can deny or doubt of; <hi>Indulgences,</hi> ſo ample, as no Society ever had larger; So many, as meerly to mention them, would take up another hours time, and tire out your patience; there being no <hi>Pope</hi> ſince <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, who hath not freely opened the Churches Storehouſe, and added new pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, prerogatives, and benefits unto his predeceſſors liberalitie, in ſo much as I find above forty authentick Bulls and Inſtruments iſſued forth of that highest ſpirituall Court, for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I may add to this large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory of ſpirituall profits; That to be of this Confraternity, is a probable ſign of being <hi>predeſtinated</hi> to eternall feli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:133233:53"/> what ſurer token of election, can one have in this life, than to be aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſo many good Souls, aſpiring zealouſly, and unanimouſly to piety, to perfection, to ſalvation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> the laſt profit, (to let paſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others) is a confidence, a comfort, and a kind of ſecurity in the article of <hi>Death.</hi> Death is commonly accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with <hi>three</hi> corroſives. <hi>Bitterneſs,</hi> becauſe of the Ceſsation of all pleaſures, the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now the devout and diligent mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this ſacred Confraternity are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the moſt part of theſe alarm's: For death ſeems not to them ſo <hi>bitter,</hi> becauſe long before expected, prevented, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ovided for: The enemies aſſaults and temptations are not to them ſo <hi>dreadfull</hi> and dangerous, becauſe the dayly uſe of their ſpirituall weapons renders them expert in theſe combats, able to foil their adverſaries, and experienc'd to defend
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:133233:54"/> themſelves: The apprehenſion of Gods Judgments is not to them ſo terrible, becauſe they continually think of them, and accordingly order their Life and actions, diſcharge their conſciences of ſin, practiſe works of piety, and endeavour to acquire the ſacred Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins favour in hope to have her then their friend and advocate, which is ſurely the best way to dy with ſafety and ſecurity: <hi>The juſt man dy's</hi> (ſays Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>) <hi>as well as the wicked;</hi> yet the juſt man dy's with this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and aſſurance, that the ending of his life here, is the entrance into a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Life hereafter; and therefore he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving dy's to the world; that dying, he may begin to live to God: O <hi>Life</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy! O <hi>Death</hi> truly happy! where the conſcience is pure, and the Soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted!</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome part of the ſpirituall profits, which proceed from this renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Society of the ROSARY: It now remains that I briefly tell you, how you may become capable to participate of theſe priviledges and prerogatives, and what duty and devotion befits the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervants of the ſacred Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the true members of this moſt holy Society.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:133233:54"/>
               <p>For it is not enough to have regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred your names in the <hi>Roſary</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue, to enter with the reſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Chappell, to be externally aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this Confraternity: but in the firſt place.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You muſt reſolve upon an honeſt, honourable, holy life; A reformation of your manners, a renouncing of all vice and vanity, a purſute of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu, piety, perfection; Yea, you muſt ſtrive to ſurpaſs in devotion and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity all ſuch other worldlings, as have not that honour and happyneſs you have, to be of the bleſſed Virgins familie: for you (O devout <hi>Roſariſts!</hi>) have dedicated your ſelves more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to God ſervice, you make a more ſpeciall profeſſion to honour his holy Mother, than they who walk in the wide track of the World: and if you ſurpaſs them not in perfection, how deſerve you the title of her particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſervants? If you make not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in your lives and actions more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie, Humilitie, Patience, Piety, Devotion, and all ſorts of vertues, than others; how are you worthy to be her ſpeciall friends and favourite? Finally if you pretend to be truly her children and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:133233:55"/> domeſticks, ſhe expects from you cleaneſs of heart, purity of conſcience, ſanctity of life and converſation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And in order to obtain this mundicity, purity, and ſacntity, you muſt have a high eſteem, and make fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of the Sacrament of <hi>Penance,</hi> as being the main Pillar of a ſpirituall life, the ſoveraign Medicin to recover our Souls decayed health, the firſt and fundamentall ſtep to all perfection.</p>
               <p>Yes, every Chriſtian, who hath any Zeal for his own ſalvation, much more <hi>we</hi> (who make a profeſſion of ſomewhat more than ordinary devotion) muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently upon his lapſe into mortall ſin diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Soul to Contrition, his mouth to Confeſſion, his hands to Satisfaction, his body to <hi>Penance,</hi> which is the true <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany</hi> curing theſe bitings, the wholſom <hi>Mithridat</hi> expelling theſe poyſons, the <hi>clear Fountain</hi> cleanſing us from theſe filths and impurities. O how important is the obſervation of this point, to all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to piety and perfection, and how prejudiciall the neglect of it?</p>
               <p>For firſt, a Soul faln into one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſin, hath ſet the dore open to let in a ſecond, and that makes way for many followers: Such is the weight of ſin
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:133233:55"/> (ſays S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Gregory</hi>) that it bears dow the Soul under it, and ſways the incli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nation to commit more and more, on Abyſſus calling on another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> a Soul in mortall ſin, looſes all her good works, all merit, all hope of Heaven, all title to eternall happyneſs: no alms avail her, no prayers profit her, no auſterities help her, no good actions can open to her the gates of Paradiſe, without the key of an intire confeſſion, or a true <hi>Contrition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſin as it gains time, gets ſtrength, becoms inſenſibly maſter of the Soul, ſhutts up the dores againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin mercy, and at length leaves her in deſpair of pardon, and makes her give over all hopes of favour, and petitioning for grace. Ah! what comfort, what confidence, what means of ſalvation is left to a miſerable Soul, that wilfully perſevers in her impiety? The longer ſhe ſtays in it, the deeper ſhe ſinks into it, the leſſe ſhe deſerves favour, the more highly ſhe provokes Heavens anger and revenge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and which is yet worſe, a Soul wounded with mortall ſin (and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by <hi>Confeſſion</hi> or <hi>Contrition</hi>) is continually worried with a worm of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:133233:56"/> and if ſhe be grown ſo inſenſible, as not to feel now its gnawings, ſhe ſhall ſurely reſent its diſmall bitings at the approaching hour of death, and much more piercingly after her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when this <hi>worm</hi> that devours her <hi>ſhall never dy</hi> where the <hi>fire</hi> that burns her ſhall never be extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>Behold the inevitable ruins, the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reparable loſſes, the unexplicable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, which are by them incurred, who after their fall, delay to do Penance. Let it be therefore your chief care (O devout <hi>Roſariſts!</hi>) to ariſe ſpeedily, to preſent your ſelves preſently to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall of confeſſion, to announce your frailty, renounce your impiety, that ſo you may obtain grace to walk after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more warily. For as a ſpot or ſtain is ſooner rubbed off at firſt, than when ſunk down to the bottom; ſo it is with ſin, the cure is deſperate, when the diſeaſe is deeply rooted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The frequent uſe of the Holy E<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CHARIST is no leſs neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all faithfull and devout Chriſtians, where they are viſited by God himſelf, honoured with his Reall Preſence, fed with his ſacred fleſh, made the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, the Cabinet of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:133233:56"/> Word Incarnat, the Tabernacle of the Immenſe Trinity: the Throne, the Heaven, the Palace, the Paradiſe of the whol divinity.</p>
               <p>O what priviledges! what profits? what prerogatives? to have their ſins pardoned, temptations quelled, paſſions conquered, enemies repulſed, new ſtrength granted, all ſorts of graces communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated? To have the ſpirit cleared, the memory awaked, the will inflamed, the underſtanding illuminated, the heart confirmed, the appetite regulated, the reaſon inſtructed, the ſenſuality re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, the whol man divinized? To receive the antipaſts of Paradiſe, the pledges of eternall bliſs and beatitude? who would not endeavour to be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly partaker of ſuch heights, ſuch honours, ſuch happineſſes?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another important practice of devout Chriſtians is to hear <hi>Maſs</hi> as often as they may; for it is a Sacrifice, whereby the merits of our Redeemers Paſſion are applyed to us. A Sacrifice, in which and by which: thanks are rendred to the Divin Majeſty, for all the benefits received from his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. A <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> of infinit worth and efficacie, inflowing multitudes of graces,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:133233:57"/> favours, and bleſſings upon the devout aſſiſtants, which this time and place permit me not to particularize.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Furthermore, to hear Gods Word preached and announced (if that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be obtained) is alſo a point of great piety, profit, and merit; nor is there indeed any more <hi>expreſs ſign</hi> of a Christians belonging to Chriſts flock and fold, than the frequent and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate hearing of his divin Word, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own ſaying: <hi>He that is of God hears his Word,</hi> and <hi>my ſheep hear my voyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely, they who lend a willing ear to their prime Paſtours voyce, (preached to them by his Miſſioners and Officers) teſtifie thereby that they are his loving and obedient Sheep; the imitators of his Bleſſed Mother, <hi>(who kept all his words carefully in her heart)</hi> and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren deſigned for his heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The laſt piece of devotion, which I ſhall now mention belonging to pious Chriſtians and eſpecially to the religious children of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> is to addict themſelves to the reading of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <hi>Conflict,</hi> and <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> and other good, holy, and ſpirituall books, for theſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:133233:57"/> are the dumb maſters which teach us the leſſons of true wiſdom and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Philoſophy; Theſe are the fire-ſteels of Gods love and fear, the matches of devotion, the interpreters of ſacred my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, the pilots of our pilgrimage, the Regiſters of Gods wondrous works, the Court-Rolls where we may turn to the authentique effects of his ſevere juſtice, and of his ſweet mercy.</p>
               <p>Behold, theſe are the true badges of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect brethren &amp; ſiſters; theſe are the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable ſeals of devout Confraternities; theſe are the eſſentiall properties of our Queen-Mothers children and ſervants. Study them ſeriouſly (O devout Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts!) and endeavour punctually to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and keep them.</p>
               <p>

                  <p>We ſhall therefore (both in this and the following points) content our ſelves to <hi>declare</hi> the Truth, not <hi>diſpute</hi> it, to <hi>preſuppoſe</hi> it, not <hi>prove</hi> it, to <hi>ſet down Maxims,</hi> not <hi>Problems;</hi> and our endeavours ſhall be to <hi>excite</hi> the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

                  <p>Wherefore abſtracting here from the ſacred Virgin-Mothers own Worth, Dignity, Prerogatives, Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Excellencies, (which are briefly touched in the precedent Oration, and which are abundantly capable to raviſh the whol World with her love and admiration and move them to her honour and ſervice) we ſhall inſiſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon ſome of the moſt ſignall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which redound to our ſelves by our devotion towards her, reducing them to theſe <hi>five</hi> generall heads.</p>

                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:133233:62"/>
                  <p>Who would not then become a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Child and obedient ſervant of ſo pious and tender a Mother? who would not ſtrive to gain the favour and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſo faithfull a friend, and ſo powerfull a Patroneſs?</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, <hi>That ſhe is liberall and bountifull in beſtowing benefits and favours upon her children and ſervants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Worldly affection (if it be true and perfect) hath ſuch power over the heart of Man, as to cauſe him to confer freely upon his beloved object, whatſoever he moſt dearly prizes and eſteems. And can it be conceiv'd that the <hi>Saints</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (and particularly <hi>Hers,</hi> which far excels <hi>that</hi> of all Men, Saints, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells together) being more perfect, ſhould be leſs liberall?</p>
                  <p>The glorious Virgin, (ſay our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors) is the <hi>Treaſureſs</hi> of the celeſtiall Riches, the <hi>Diſpenſatrix</hi> of Gods gifts, ſhe carryes the keys of the divin Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers: All power is given to you (great Empreſs of both Worlds! ſays her mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifluous Doctor) ſo that you have leave to do what you pleaſe in Heaven and Earth! And ſhe is ſurely no niggard in diſpenſing them, as being equally bountifull and powerfull, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:133233:62"/> good and great, equally courteous and charitable: Why dread you, (O ye devout children and ſervants of <hi>MARY,</hi> ſays the ſame Doctor) to approach your Mother and Miſtris? There is nothing in <hi>her</hi> of rigidneſs and auſterity; She's full of meekneſs, charity, courteſie towards all them that ſue unto her.</p>
                  <p>I well know (ſayes the antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Theophilactus</hi>) that you (O moſt glorious Queen-Mother!) are the great Protectrice of mankind: And who is he (O mercifull Princeſs!) that having plac'd his confidence in you, hath remain'd confounded? Who is that <hi>he</hi> or <hi>ſhe,</hi> amongſt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Adam,</hi> who having beſought your ſuccour, and aſſiſtance, hath been rejected and abandon'd? Let's there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make (to her our humble ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes in all our neceſſities, ſince ſhe is ſo <hi>Powerfull</hi> to aſſiſt us, ſo <hi>Mercifull</hi> to admit us, ſo <hi>Ready</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us.</p>
                  <p>The third is, <hi>that ſhe comforts her children and ſervants in all their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, perſecutions, deſolations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This follows from the former: For if (as a moſt tender Mother) ſhe loves &amp;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:133233:63"/> cheriſhes her children &amp; ſervants; and ſhow'rs down ſo many goods, graces, and favours upon them; ſhe ſurely compaſſionat's them in ther preſſing neceſſities; For it is then chiefly, that true friendſhip ſhews it ſelf, true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity expands it ſelf, true liberality dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes it ſelf. Certainly (ſays a pious Author) were all the devout ſervants and children of <hi>Mary</hi> ſummon'd out of their graves to give in their ſeverall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to this Interrogation: How oft have you heartily invok'd your holy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris and Mother in your neceſſities, and been deny'd her ſpeedy ſuccour and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance? They would unanimouſly exclaim with her holy S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Bernard; Taceat ille, &amp;c.</hi> Let that impious tongue be ſilent (O moſt compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat Virgin Mother!) which dares fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly avouch that you have fail'd to help and comfort him, whenſoever he faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully call'd upon you in his diſtreſſed condition.</p>
                  <p>Therefore S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>German</hi> (the Patriark of Conſtantinople) thus addreſſes his diſcourſe unto her: no one is ſav'd (O moſt ſacred Virgin!) but by your aſſiſtance: no one if free from miſerie (O muſt pure Virgin!) but by your
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:133233:63"/> means: no one receives Gods gifts and graces (O moſt mercifull Virgin!) but by your mediation: No one obtains the pardon of his offences, (O Virgin worthy of all praiſe and honour!) but by your prayers and interceſſion. Who (ſays he) after your Divin Son, takes ſo much care of poor Mankind as your ſelf? Who ſo zealouſly defends and ſtrengthens weak man in his troubles and temptations? Who ſo readily ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours him in his afflictions and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions? Who ſo charitably excuſes his crimes, pleads his cauſe, procures his pardon, and delivers him from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere puniſhment, which his ſins have juſtly deſerved?</p>
                  <p>Let therefore each afflicted Soul (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds this holy Patriark) make to you O Compaſſionat Mother! his humble addreſſes: let him who perceives his frail veſſell to be in danger of drowning amidſt the impetuous winds and waves of this wicked and tempeſtuous World, caſt his eyes up to you (bright Star of the Sea!) and let him reſt confident that you will ſpeedily and ſecurely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him to his deſired haven.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is, <hi>That ſhe is their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Advocate in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:133233:64"/>
                  <p>The cauſe is half gaind, that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by a powerfull Advocate, And who can poſſibly be imagin'd more Powerfull, than the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, pleading at her own Sons Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There</hi> ſhe ſuſtains her childrens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, embraces their protection, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures their pardon, diverts the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their deſerved damnation, and omits nothing, which may conduce to the appeaſing of their ſoveraign Judg, and the ſaving of their Souls.</p>
                  <p>O faithfull Patoneſs of afflicted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners! How fitly doth holy Church qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify you with this Title?</p>

                     <l>Upon our miſerable ſtate,</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>For (as the learned <hi>Caſſian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms) all our affairs of higheſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are in your holy hands, and the ſalvation of all mankind conſiſts in the multitude of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s graces and favours.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:133233:64"/>
                  <p>We may therefore well hope for a happy iſſue, ſince we have an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate (ſays her devout S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Bernard</hi>) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with all the conditions, which are requiſit, and likely to carry the cauſe, which are three.</p>

                  <p>The fifth is, <hi>That ſhe procures for them a happy departure out of this world, the ſalvation of their ſouls, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of eternall Felicity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What more can you expect (O de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Children and Servants of <hi>Mary!</hi>)
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:133233:66"/> than to dy well, and become eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy, which is the end of your Creation, and the Crown of all your endeavours?</p>
                  <p>And ſurely, it is the generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd opinion of all the Doctors, that it is impoſſible for any one, who dy's a faithfull ſervant of the ſacred Virgin, to periſh eternally: And they give the reaſon; becauſe it is not poſſible they ſhould dy impenitent, who have the Faith to call heartily upon her, whoſe powerfull Prayers will obtain for them a diſpoſition to grace, and a contrition for their offences.</p>
                  <p>This is frequently aſſerted by Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> (as hath been before allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) And by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Anſelm</hi> in theſe words: You (O compaſſionate <hi>Mary!</hi>) embrace the poor ſinner with a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection, and you never leave him, till your Son, appeaſed by your prayers, gives him his pardon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives him into his favour and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And elſewhere, <hi>O Beatiſſima</hi> (ſays S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Anſelm) <hi>ſicut omnis a to averſus, &amp; a te deſpectus, neceſſe eſt ut intereat: It a omnis ad te converſus, &amp; a te re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectus, impoſſibile eſt ut pereat.</hi> O moſt bleſſed <hi>Mary!</hi> as he muſt needs
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:133233:66"/> periſh who turns his back to you, and whom you reject from your favour; ſo it is impoſſible he ſhould periſh who is zealous of your honour, and whom you vouchſafe to behold and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Theophilus;</hi> I know (ſays he) O ſoveraign Lady, that you have too great care of ſinners to quit them in their greateſt neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Origen,</hi> I hold (ſays he) as an aſſured verity; that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> will never abandon that perſon, who implores her aſſiſtance in the time of his neceſſity: for ſhe is full of goodneſs, full of mercy, full of grace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot refuſe her compaſſion to him that calls upon her.</p>
                  <p>We conclude with this ſentence of the glorious Martyr S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Ignatius:</hi> you (O bleſſed <hi>Mary!</hi>) are the ſacred Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſoveraign Deity, the true Mother of the worlds Saviour, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted Mother of the poor Sinner: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me now into the boſome of your Maternall mercy and compaſſion.</p>

                  <p>THis precedent Foundation being ſolidly ſetled in our hearts; (to wit, that a ſingular devotion towards the ſacred Virgin, is ſo beneficiall unto us; as hath been briefly declared and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly proved by the expreſs teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of ſo many of our pious Fathers and Predeceſſors; to which many more might have been added, as many be ſeen at large in <hi>Jodocus Coccius;</hi> in the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of the ſacred Virgins <hi>Triple Crown,</hi> and in the ſeverall Authors upon this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>It now behoves us to chooſe out (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the many wayes of honouring and ſerving Gods bleſſed Mother) that particular ſort of devotion, <hi>which</hi> may probably be moſt pleaſing to God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to our ſelves, and gratefull to the moſt pure and Immaculate Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:133233:67"/>
                  <p>And this (without the leaſt thought of undervaluing any ones judgement, or derogating from the ſeverall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of honouring her, who can never be ſufficiently honoured by any human induſtry and invention:) we conceive to be the devout practice of the ſacred <hi>Roſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if we ſeriouſly conſider its <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> its <hi>Antiquity,</hi> its <hi>Generality,</hi> its <hi>Facility,</hi> its large <hi>Community of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> its vaſt <hi>Treaſures of Indulgences,</hi> and the like prerogatives, (which are compendiouſly enumerated in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Oration:) we ſhall find it far exceeds all other ſorts of devotion (of this nature) whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>And ſurely, <hi>that</hi> manner of Prayer, cannot but be very pleaſing to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord and Maker, profitable to our ſelves, and gratefull to the bleſſed Virgin, <hi>which</hi> directly tends to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the divin honour, to the promotion of our own ſalvation, and to the encreaſe of the ſacred Virgin Mothers glory.</p>
                  <p>Now the exerciſes of the holy <hi>Roſary,</hi> aym directly at theſe three heroick ends:</p>
                  <p>For <hi>firſt,</hi> ſince the <hi>Roſary</hi> (as ſhall
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:133233:68"/> be hereafter declared) conſiſts of the two richeſt pieces of Chriſtian Piety, which are the <hi>Pater noſter</hi> and <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> and of the principall myſteries of our Chriſtian Faith, What <hi>ſubject</hi> imaginable can be more proper, what <hi>object</hi> poſſible can be more powerfull, to rayſe our Souls to the love, prayſe, and honour of our Creator and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, than the due and daily conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Divin Myſteries, which are (as it were) the ſacred Tables, and lively Pictures, repreſenting continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to our memories, their admirable benefits, their exceſſive love, their infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit liberality to Mankind?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> By what Prayers can we more confidently promiſe to our ſelves the obtaining of our juſt deſires, (and conſequently the promoting of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;) than by the <hi>Pater noſter</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated by our Redeemers own divin mouth, enjoynd by his ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be frequently us'd by all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtians, and by him indu'd with ſo great efficacy and vertue?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by what ladder of prayſe, can we more probably reach the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Virgin-Mothers perfections than by the <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> which was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:133233:68"/> in Heaven by the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> it ſelf, and thence brought down to the Earth by his Embaſſador, the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> in <hi>which,</hi> all the greatneſſes, excellencies, and prerogatives of Gods bleſſed Mother, are ſo briefly, diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, divinly couched together. (For <hi>Ave</hi> is as much as to ſay, <hi>ſine vae,</hi> without woe, without ſin, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction: <hi>Gratia plena,</hi> declares her full of all grace, vertu, and goodneſs, <hi>Dominus tecum,</hi> denounces her the happy Mother of the Almighty.)</p>
                  <p>Since therefore the <hi>Ave Maria</hi> is a compendious abridgment of all the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-Mothers prayſes: Surely it muſt needs be a ſalutation to her moſt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, pleaſing, and acceptable.</p>

                  <p>THIS Title is chiefly intended for their ſatisfaction, who fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceive, that the uſe of the <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the devotion of the <hi>Bondage,</hi> and all high manners of honouring Gods
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:133233:69"/> moſt holy Mother; are unfit, (or at leaſt) improper and inconvenient to be practis'd in ſuch places as are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread with hereſie, and by ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as are liable to perſecution: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the treatiſes of ſuch ſubjects fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into <hi>their</hi> hands, <hi>who</hi> are of ſo contrary a judgment; turn commonly to their great ſcandall, and to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent detriment of the Catholique cauſe and Religion.</p>
                  <p>But this ſurely argues a great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their <hi>Faith,</hi> and is a plain er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and miſtake of their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                  <p>For it is <hi>there</hi> principally, that this manner of Piety ought to be moſt zealouſly practis'd, and moſt diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propagated, <hi>where</hi> it is moſt mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly impugn'd, and moſt unjuſtly and violently perſecuted: and as the deceived miſcreants of theſe our dayes and in this our Countrey, endeavour (by all manner of falſe ſubtilties, and blaſphemous untruths) to derogate from the Soveraign Queen <hi>Maryes</hi> glory; ſo it behoves every faithfull Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, to procure (with all poſſible care, induſtry, and devotion) the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification &amp; encreaſe of her moſt juſt,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:133233:69"/> due and deſerved honour and prayſes.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, though the moſt ſacred Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> (being <hi>Gratia plena,</hi> full of grace and goodneſs; <hi>Mater miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiae,</hi> the Mother of mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; and <hi>Mater Dei,</hi> the Mother of the Almighty) is both willing and powerfull to afford all ſorts of aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances whatſoever, for which ſhe is humbly implored:</p>
                  <p>Yet it is her ſingular and peculiar propertie, to deſtroy hereſies, and ſo to terrifie all the Satanicall Armyes of her Sons and his Churches adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that they are defeated, and put to flight, at the ſole appearance of <hi>her</hi> formidable preſence and power, <hi>who</hi> is ſtyled, <hi>Terribilis ut caſtrorum acies ordinata,</hi> Dreadfull to theſe Rebells, as an Army rang'd in battail array; And to whom the <hi>Church</hi> joyfully fings in gratulation of theſe her ſignall victories: <hi>Gaude Maria Virgo, cunctas haereſes ſola interemiſti in univerſo Mundo,</hi> Rejoyce (O you glorious Conquereſs! who alone have deſtroyed all hereſies in the whol World.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this a lately invented Title, as <hi>hers</hi> and <hi>our</hi> Enemies vainly urge and inculcate: For it is above <hi>five
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:133233:70"/> hundred</hi> years ſince Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch'd this to be one of the Mother of <hi>Powers</hi> ſpeciall Prerogatives, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding his Sermon (preach'd in the honour of her glorious Aſſumption) in theſe words, <hi>Sola contrivit univerſam haereticam pravitatem,</hi> She alone hath daſh'd all hereticall impiety.</p>
                  <p>And well might Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> aſſert this propoſition, who knew the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of paſt ages, and had read the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of his holy Predeceſſors related in the antient Councells of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedonia,</hi> againſt the <hi>Maniche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Neſtorians, Heſuidians</hi> and <hi>other</hi> Heretiques.</p>

                     <hi>FIrſt,</hi> becauſe as a Roſe-bed hath many buſhes, bringing forth ſweet Roſes, which refreſh and recreate the ſenſes of ſuch as gather them: So this manner of praying contains a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Paters</hi> and <hi>Ave's,</hi> which won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully comfort, rejoyce, and perfect <hi>their</hi> ſouls, <hi>who</hi> with a due devotion, with an humble reverence to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin Preſence, and with a diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the ſacred Myſteries of our Saviours Life and Paſſion, ſhall uſe and frequent them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly:</hi> Becauſe as we commonly name ſuch works or collections, <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> which contain the prime and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall points, that can be deliver'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſubject, (for that the <hi>Roſe</hi> is the Princeſs of all flowers): So this manner of Devotion is fitly call'd a <hi>Roſary,</hi> for that it involves the chief form's of Prayer; to wit, the <hi>Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> (which, as Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> largely proves, is the prime of all Prayers, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:133233:74"/> to the Divin Majeſty); and the <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> which is the chief of all Salutations directed to the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly;</hi> becauſe this word <hi>Roſary,</hi> ſignifies alſo a Garland of Roſes; which name may properly be apply'd to this pious Exerciſe; it being a certain ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Crown &amp; circular Garland com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted of theſe chief Prayers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Sacred Virgin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly:</hi> Becauſe as the Roſe-Buſh conſiſts of Leaves, Prickles, Flowers; ſo this our Roſary is compos'd of Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Dolorous, and Glorious Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: The <hi>Joyfull,</hi> correſpond to the Leaves; The <hi>Dolorous,</hi> reſemble the prickles; The <hi>Glorious,</hi> ſympathize with the Flowers.</p>

                  <head>§. 7. That the Roſary comprehends the two ſorts of Prayer; Vocall and Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</head>
                  <p>MEntall Prayer, is conceiv'd onely in the Soul and Spirit, without any pronunciation of words.</p>
                  <p>Vocall Prayer is pronounc'd with
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:133233:74"/> the Mouth, and alſo conceiv'd in the mind.</p>
                  <p>The Mentall prayer is ſurely more perfect:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> as being more like that of the celeſtiall Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As conſiſting in a ſimple and quiet aſpect of the underſtanding, without any motion or mixture of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> as being more conceal'd from the ſworn Enemy of our good; and therefore leſs expos'd to the danger of his temptations, and of externall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions.</p>
                  <p>And this ſort of Prayer is moſt proper for ſuch as have made ſome progreſs in a ſpirituall courſe of life, and who can <hi>ſoar</hi> aloft upon <hi>the ſwift wings</hi> of their internall deſires, and affections, fixing the eyes of their ſpirits upon the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Splendor of the Divinity it ſelf which they can as ſtedfaſtly behold and contemplate, as the Eagle doth the Sun.</p>
                  <p>The vocall Prayer, though 'tis leſs perfect; yet is conceiv'd to be more proper for the generality of Lay-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and eſpecially for all ignorant, illiterate, and unexperienc'd ſouls,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:133233:75"/> who are commonly farr more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to comprehend exteriour words, actions, and ceremonies, than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour ways and conceptions of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Now, to recite the ſacred <hi>Roſary</hi> as we ought; we are to make joint uſe of both theſe manners of Prayer, vocall and Mentall: <hi>That</hi> to pronounce the <hi>Pater</hi> and <hi>Ave</hi> diſtinctly with our mouths: <hi>This</hi> to meditate devoutly upon the divin Myſteries.</p>
                  <p>And this way of vocall and mentall Prayer may (in a ſhort time of practiſe) become eaſy and familiar, even to the meaneſt capacities; if whil'ſt their tongue is employd in the pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prayers, their mind be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the Conſideration of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Myſtery.</p>

                  <head>§. 8. Three advices concerning this manner of Praying and Meditating.</head>
                  <p>HEre by the way, the devout <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſariſt</hi> may pleaſe to take particular notice of theſe three important adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſments.</p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:133233:75"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That though there are many points ſet down, and many Myſteries propos'd for the Theams and ſubjects of our Meditations: yet it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for him to run over all thoſe points; no, nor all thoſe myſteries as oft as he recites the <hi>Roſary:</hi> but if he can ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertain his ſpirit upon one onely point, or one onely Myſterie; he may not only lawfully, but very laudably ſtay there, without haſting forward: (like the Bee, (which forſakes not that Flowre upon which ſhe firſt faſtens, as long as ſhe finds any ſweetneſs to be ſuck'd from it:) referring the other points and Myſteries to another ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall repaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That ſince in all well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Mentall Prayer, there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currencie of the underſtanding and will: (we ſpeak not here, of that high Exerciſe of Recollection largly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in our ſpirituall Conqueſt) it being the proper office of the underſtanding in Mentall Prayer, to move the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the will, and to give it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to fly or follow what is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto it, as good or evill; without which concurrency of theſe two powers of the ſoul, all Meditation would prove
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:133233:76"/> fruitleſs, and unprofitable: Therefore the underſtanding is to repreſent to its internall eyes, that Myſtery (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it intends to employ it ſelf) as if it were then really done and tranſacted before it: Which is a moſt efficacious way (as long experience hath taught devout perſons), to contain the ſpirits evagation, within its due bounds and limits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That as ſoon as by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and diſcourſe of the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, there is diſcover'd ſome devout conception, the Will be forthwith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to holy affections, either of love or hatred; of avoyding or embracing, of joy or grief, according to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the preſent Meditation, the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of the underſtanding, and the internall motion of Gods Holy Spirit. For ſince (as hath been ſaid) the chief office of the underſtanding in all men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Prayer, is to inflame the Will with ſacred affections; And ſince <hi>Affective Prayer</hi> (as all ſpirituall Authors agree) is far more perfect in it ſelf, profitable to us, and pleaſing to the Divin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, than diſcourſive Prayer; ſurely all diſcourſes ought to ceaſe, as ſoon as theſe affections are ſufficiently ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and excited.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:133233:76"/>
                  <p>Wherefore the devout <hi>Roſariſts,</hi> and whoſoever aimes at the ſpeedy amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his life, and the advancement of his ſoul in the way of perfection by the means of mentall prayer muſt take heed of permitting all, or overmuch to his underſtanding, and nothing or very little to his Will; as may more largly be ſeen in the Maxims of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Conqueſt.</p>

                  <head>§. 9. A difficultie concerning this conjunction of vocall and Mentall Prayer, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd and clear'd.</head>
                  <p>BUT ſince the Recitall and ſenſe of our <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Salutation,</hi> is altogether diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and forraign, as to the Meditation upon the Myſteries: And ſince our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding cannot attend to ſeverall objects, and apply it ſelf to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of divers ſenſes at one and the ſame time: How can this joint mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of vocall and mentall Prayer chooſe but diſſipate and diſtract the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: and conſequently deſtroy the ſoul's ſetled attention and recollection,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:133233:77"/> which is the very life of all Prayer, and without which the vocall rehearſing of the devouteſt words, is but a fruitleſs lip-labour; and the meditating upon the divineſt Myſteries, is but a meer loſs of time, and of no effect and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon, Some are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it were not amiſs to divide them, in the recitall of the <hi>Roſary:</hi> And becauſe mentall Prayer is the higher, harder, and perfecter; they give advice, (following herein the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature, which generally proceeds from the leſs to the greater) to begin with the vocall recitation; thereby to excite their ſpirits ardour to aſcend to the contemplation of the propoſed My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie: As for example, after the <hi>Roſariſt</hi> ſhall have devoutly recited his firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade in honour of the firſt Myſterie; he deſiſts a while from a farther proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the reſt, till he hath ſilently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd that Myſterie, and drawn from thence ſome pious affections and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall reſolutions. Which way of thus ſeparating the vocall recitall of the Prayers, from the Mentall rumination upon the Myſteries, though it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a very profitable practiſe: yet
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:133233:77"/> ſurely to couple both together, and ſo to make this Prayer run upon two feet, or rather fly with two wings up to Heaven; ſeems far more powerfull and efficacious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For,</hi> as concerning what is objected, of the diſſipation of our atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion by this conjunction of vocall &amp; mentall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: The devout <hi>Roſariſt</hi> may confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ground himſelf upon the doctrin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd in our <hi>Spirituall Conqueſt,</hi> and derived from S. <hi>Thomas:</hi> That all vocall Prayers (to render them profitable) muſt neceſſarily be accompanied with ſome one of theſe three Attentions:</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is, an Attention to the <hi>Words;</hi> pronouncing them cleerly, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, diſtinctly: which Attention is <hi>good</hi> and ſufficient:</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, an Attention to the true <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> of the words, whether Literall or Myſticall; which Attention is much <hi>better,</hi> (and more profitable for ſuch as can practiſe it), but not abſolutly neceſſary; becauſe they who pray in a language they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not, cannot poſſibly attain to it, and yet (according to the Churches deciſion, and all our Doctors opinion) they ceaſe not therefore to pray profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:133233:78"/>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> is, an Attention to the <hi>end,</hi> at which all pious Chriſtians aym in all their Prayers, and which is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally Gods honour and glory, the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own ſoul's, and the good of their neighbour: which Attention is <hi>beſt</hi> of all, and moſt benefi iall: for it is ſo ample, that it ſupplyes all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the two former; and ſo eaſie, that the moſt ſimple Idiot may procure it, in whatſoever language he powrs forth his petitions.</p>
                  <p>Now the uſuall and ordinary way of reciting the <hi>Roſary</hi> by interlacing vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and mentall Prayer, doth not at all hinder or divert the thought (thus fixed and directed by the underſtanding), from this <hi>chief and common end;</hi> nor putts the leaſt impediment to this laſt, principall, and onely neceſſary Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>THough every zealous Chriſtian (by concurring with Gods every
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:133233:78"/> where profferr'd grace); may ſo duly, diligently, and perſeverantly practiſe his Devotions in his own privat Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; as to arrive at the perfection of vertu, and the ſalvation of his ſoul: yet theſe heights are not there obtain'd with that alacrity, facilitie, ſecurity; as by being joyn'd to ſacred Confrater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; which are the Academies of Devotion, the Schools of ſanctity, the Buttreſſes of Religion, Piety perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And where (under the obſervation and Practiſe of certain ſpirituall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, tending to the common end of our Creation) the fervour and good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of his faithfull Aſſociats, warm his Tepidity, excite his Piety, and add the continuall fewell of courage and conſtancy to his holy Reſolutions; according to that ſaying of the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: <hi>Si unus ceciderit fulcietur ab al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero &amp;c.</hi> where many are united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if one falls, he may be rais'd up by his fellow; and if one be aſſaulted, two may be able to repulſe the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. For, <hi>Funiculus triplex difficile rumpitur:</hi> A triple cord (ſays he) is not eaſily broken: And one man alone, is as a ſmall, ſingle, ſlender threed; feeble, frail, and eaſily paſh'd in peeces;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:133233:79"/> but being twiſted and ty'd to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the ſtrong bands of a ſpirituall friendſhip, he becoms formidable to all his Infernall Enemyes.</p>
                  <p>And this by reaſon of the mutuall ſuccour of their multipli'd prayers and merits, according to that pithy expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Saint <hi>Ambroſe; Dum ſinguli orant pro omnibus, ſequitur ut omnes orent pro ſingulis.</hi> When as every ſingle perſon pray's for all, it follows, that all pray for every ſingle perſon.</p>
                  <p>Now, though generally in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternities, there is a Communication of prayers, merits, and ſpirituall goods, yet not in all alike.

                  <p>The learned Doctor <hi>Navar,</hi> gives the reaſon hereof: Becauſe (ſays he) this Communication is expreſs'd and declar'd in the Statuts, Erections, and Confirmations of this Confraternity, without which particular expreſſion they could not enjoy that ſpeciall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg.

                  <p>
                     <hi>From</hi> all which, may be gathered this brief definition of an Indulgence. That, <hi>It is a gift, a Relaxation, an Acquittance of the temporall pain, due to the Divin Juſtice for the ſins already pardon'd by Confeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this Relaxation is twofold; <hi>Generall,</hi> when the Indulgence is Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, which quits us from all the pain due to our ſins. And <hi>Reſtrain'd,</hi> when the Indulgence imports only ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Day's, <hi>Quarantins,</hi> and year's of Pardon. When therefore you find in the <hi>Popes</hi> conceſſions, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of ſo many days, <hi>Quarantins,</hi> or years: you are to underſtand it of the days and years of this world, and not of Purgatory: As for example, He that gains an Indulgence of an <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years,</hi> ſatisfies the divin Juſtice, as much, as if for an hundred years ſpace he had done ſevere Penance. So likewiſe a <hi>Quarantin</hi> is as much as if he had Faſted a whol Lent, according to the cuſtom, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Where you muſt take notice; That for every mortall ſin, the ſacred <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> ordain ſeven years Penance: ſo that for 14. or 15. Mortall crimes, he who hath committed them, ſhould in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:133233:83"/> rigour undergo an hundred years pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which is above the age and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of human nature. Whereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the great profit of Indulgences, to ſolace our weakneſs, and ſhorten our pains; whch muſt ſurely other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be payd to the divin Juſtice, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſevere Penance in this world, on by more ſevere puniſhments in the next; though not neceſſarily long: ſince they may be intenſively ſo rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that one day <hi>there</hi> may be in quantity and quality of puniſhments, more than ſeven years Penance of this World.</p>
                  <p>But you may ask, what means a plenary, and a <hi>Quarantin,</hi> or a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and Ten yearts granted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>

                  <p>BUT here the devout <hi>Roſariſts</hi> are to take three Advices:</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is: That Indulgences are not indifferently obtain'd by all ſorts of perſons but by ſuch only as have duly, and diligently purified, prepar'd, and diſpos'd their ſouls to receive them by precedent Penance: Or, have led their lives in ſuch Innocencie, ſince their laſt confeſſion as that they continue in the ſtate of Grace: Or have made an Act of <hi>Contrition,</hi> and deteſtation of their mortall ſins, with purpoſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing them in fit time, and avoyding them for the future.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, That they muſt obey ſuch other particular commands, as the Bulls of Indulgences import: That is; They muſt punctually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the enjoyn'd Actions of Almeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds, Faſtings, Prayers, Proceſſions, viſitations of Altars, and all other the works of devotion and piety there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:133233:84"/>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> is, That they muſt offer up their devotions, for theſe generally recommended ends and intentions in all the conceſſions of Indulgences.

                  <p>WHereby the devout <hi>Roſariſts</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly honour God, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> upon the firſt Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days of the months, and upon the ſeven feaſts of our Bleſſed Lady; to wit, The <hi>Purification, Annunciation, Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Aſſumption, Nativity, Preſentation,</hi> and <hi>Conception,</hi> and upon the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, and other Feſtivall days of the fifteen Myſteries.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The word Proceſſion ſignifies <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally</hi> a paſſing forward from one place to another: <hi>Allegorically,</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe from vertu to vertu: <hi>Tropologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> our Peregrination upon earth: <hi>Anagogically,</hi> our tendencie towards heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Proceſſions</hi> had their beginning in the Age of the old Patriarks; in which the Ark of the Teſtament, was reverently <hi>carryed</hi> to and fro by the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> who were peculiarly ſet apart, for that <hi>ſacred purpoſe,</hi> and performed that office, with great <hi>pompe</hi> and ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: As alſo when <hi>David</hi> brought the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:133233:105"/> Ark into the Tabernacle, and <hi>Salomon</hi> into the Temple, with Hymns, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and all ſorts of muſicall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and plac'd it under the wings of the there prepared Cherubins.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Our ſolemn Proceſſions, ſeem in all things to imitate the Egreſſion of the Iſraelites out of Egypt. For [1] That people was freed by <hi>Moyſes,</hi> out of the hands of <hi>Pharao:</hi> We, by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> out of the Clutches of the Devill. [2.] <hi>Enſignes</hi> were carryed before their Troops: And before us <hi>Croſſes</hi> and <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> [3.] A pillar of <hi>Fire</hi> went before them: Burning <hi>Candles</hi> are born before us. [4.] There the <hi>Levites</hi> carryed the Tabernacle of the Covenant, and the Ark of the Teſtament: Here, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> carry the Statua's of Saints, the Reliques of the Martyrs, or the Pix with the ſacred Euchariſt. [5.] <hi>Aaron</hi> the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> follow'd them in his Pontificall habits; and our <hi>Chief Prieſt</hi> follows us in his Cope, and Church Ornaments. [6.] There was <hi>Moyſes</hi> with his Rod: Here is (a <hi>Prelate</hi> with his Croſier) a Prefect with his Officiall ſtaffe [7.] The people there march'd in compleat <hi>armour;</hi> the Clergie-men are here cover'd with
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:133233:106"/> ſacred <hi>veſtments.</hi> [8.] they were beſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with <hi>Blood:</hi> we with holy <hi>water.</hi> [9.] they had a <hi>Joſuah</hi> for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor, and conqueror, we have a <hi>Jeſus.</hi> [10.] they came at laſt into the Land of <hi>Promiſe:</hi> and we come up to the holy <hi>Altar,</hi> in hope to arrive one day at <hi>Heaven,</hi> our promis'd home and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py countrey.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our Proceſſions are the <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialls</hi> of our Redeemers mercies, minding us of the Pioceſſions <hi>he</hi> made from his eternall Fathers boſom, into the womb of the bleſſed Virgin, from her womb into the Manger: from the Manger, to Jeruſalem: from Jeruſalem, to the Mount Olivet: from Mount Olivet, back to his heavenly Father; All which we gratefully commemorating, move after his ſacred Standard the Croſs, and make to him our humble ſupplications, that we may paſs after him, from this our Pilgrimage, to his Paradiſe: from the Church Militant, to the Triumphant.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Our Proceſſions (eſpecially thoſe of the pious <hi>Roſariſts</hi> (are alſo <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorations,</hi> and <hi>Imitations</hi> of the bleſſed Virgin-Mothers journeys upon Earth: when ſhe [1.] carryed, or [2.] accompany'd, or [3.] follow'd her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:133233:106"/> Son Jeſus; [1.] when ſhe <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed</hi> him in her ſacred womb into the Mountains, to the houſe of Zacharie and Elizabeth, and into the Bethleem ſtable: and when ſhe carryed him in her ſacred armes into the Temple, and into Egypt; [2.] when ſhe <hi>accompany'd</hi> him, being twelve years old to Jeruſalem: and being thirty years old throughout Judea and Galile in his preachings. [3.] when ſhe <hi>follow'd</hi> him laden with his Croſs to Mount Calvary.</p>
                  <p>And ſurely, if all the journeys and pilgrimages from place to place, of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> upon Earth, may not properly be call'd Proceſſions: yet they may fitly be ſtyl'd the exemplary Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of our Proceſſions, which are made to their likeneſs, and in their memory and imitation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There are four chief and ſolemn Proceſſions celebrated yearly and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally by the Catholique Church. [1.] in the Purification of the bleſſed Virgin Mary: [2.] upon Palm-Sunday: [3.] upon Eaſter day: [4. upon Aſcenſion day, in memory and repreſentation of that laſt Proceſſion wherein the Diſciples waited upon our Redeemer to Mount Olivet, to ſee him aſſumpted into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:133233:107"/> where it is to be noted, that in the Primitive Church, there were made two weekly Proceſſions: one upon <hi>Sunday,</hi> in memo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y of the Reſurrection, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon <hi>Thurſday;</hi> in memory of the Aſcention: Whence ſprung up that common Proverb of Thurſdayes being neere a kin to Sunday.) But when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Feſtivities of Saints became multiplied, the Solemnity and Proceſſion of Thurſday was abrogated by <hi>Pope Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitus,</hi> and transfer'd alſo to that of Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: which is therefore ſtill obſerv'd in the joint memorie of the Reſurrection and Aſcention, in all cathedrall and conventuall Churches.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To theſe four Proceſſions may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thoſe of the <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>leſs Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;</hi> which are alſo yearly and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally celebrated; the Proceſſion of the <hi>great Litanies,</hi> upon St. <hi>Marks</hi> day, inſtituted by Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the great, to implore the divin aſſiſtance againſt the then raging Peſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lence, the Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>leſs Litanies,</hi> upon the three day's before the Aſcention begun by St. <hi>Mamertus</hi> Biſhop of Vienna, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore a remedie againſt the many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wherewith France was then affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:133233:107"/>
                  <p>Both which cuſtoms were afterwards confirm'd by the Church, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be kept by all her faithfull children.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Having prefated thus much of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions</hi> in <hi>generall,</hi> let us briefly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them of the ſacred <hi>Roſary in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi> which (as aforeſaid) are made upon each firſt Sunday of the month, and the bleſſed Virgins Feſtivities.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt Ceremonie in theſe (as in all other) Proceſſions is the <hi>carriage of the Croſs,</hi> [1.] becauſe it is the ancient and perpetuall cuſtom of the Catholique Church, to carry the <hi>Croſs</hi> before in all her ſupplications. [2.] becauſe the <hi>Croſs</hi> is the common ſigne, mark, and cogniſance of all Chriſtians. [3.] to ſhew that the pious Roſariſts ground all the hope and confidence of their prayers and ſupplications, chiefly upon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſts paſſion. [4.] becauſe the Devill being once fully conquered by the <hi>Croſs;</hi> is again foyl'd, defeated, and put to flight by theſe Proceſſions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond is, <hi>the reliques of Saints.</hi> [1.] to profeſs the Communion of the Saints of both Churches, Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant and Militant. [2.] to declare that we beg the Saints interceſſions.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:133233:108"/>
[3.] to honour God in them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third is, the <hi>Statua of the bleſſed Virgin.</hi> [1.] this is the cuſtom of the Church, and the tradition of our Anceſtors. [2.] it is a confuſion to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, and Image-haters: and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to us (at the ſight of her ſacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative) to pray unto <hi>her</hi> for their converſion, <hi>who</hi> is entitled by the Church the <hi>confoundreſs of all Hereſies through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole World;</hi> (This praying for the converſion of Heretiques, being one of the principall cauſes of theſe our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions. [3.] it is a practice, which Heaven hath frequently approv'd of, by many ſignall miracles.</p>
                  <p>Let us inſiſt a little upon this point, and prove this carriage of our bleſſed Ladies Image or Statua in Proceſſions to have been the continuall practice of the Catholique Church, by producing ſome few, but moſt famous examples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the multitude which might be cited out of authentick writers: in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to confute, not onely ſuch flat He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, as fondly affirm theſe manner of Proceſſions to be no other than modern and monkiſh inventions: but alſo ſuch ignorant and criticall Catholiques, as ſcruple to render this ſort of honour to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:133233:108"/> 
                     <hi>her,</hi> who can never be ſufficiently honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any human induſtry.</p>
                  <p>Poor deceiv d, and undevout wretches deſerving rather to be pittied for your ignorance, than to be ſatisfi'd by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in a ſubject of ſo clear evidence we will ſtick ſtedfaſtly to our well-taken up Tenents, continue cheerfully in our rightly intended devotions, and pray perſeverantly for y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur illumination, in our ſacred Proceſſions, hoping at laſt to conquer your peeviſhneſs by our pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and charity, and by her power and interceſſion: in whoſe name, for whoſe love, and to whoſe honour, we (the children of Mary) are gathered together (as brethren in one heart, ſoul and mind) to march under the Banner of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Roſary.</p>
                  <p>We therefore (returning to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended purpoſe) confidently affirm, that the <hi>Examples</hi> of our pious Anceſtors, and the <hi>miracles</hi> wrought by the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of our bleſſed Mothers Images in Proceſſion, are ſufficient warrants and motives to induce us to the ſame devout practice, <hi>Examples</hi> and <hi>miracles!</hi> which may abundantly be read throughout the whol body of the Eccleſiaſticall hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories; from whence we will borrow
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:133233:109"/> theſe few following inſtances.</p>
                  <p>And to begin with our great St, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> (who ſate in the Roman chair, in the year of Chriſt, 601. at which time the Inhabitants of that Citie dyed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly, lying in their beds, ſitting in their houſes, walking the fields, ſtanding in the ſtreets: ſo violently raging was the peſtilentiall contagion!) he ind cting a three day's ſupplication, <hi>let us</hi> (ſay's he) <hi>O my afflicted children! meet together in the Church of bleſſed Mary, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Virgin, and holy Mother of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and there w th ſighs, tears, and prayers implore the divin mercy, for the remiſſion of our ſins, and the remedie of our miſeries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The people being gathered together accordingly, <hi>He</hi> in his own perſon, takes the ſacred Virgins Picture, drawn by St. Lukes penſill, (which picture is carefully kept, and highly honoured e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven till this day, in the ſame Church of St. <hi>Marie ad Praeſepe,</hi> or, <hi>of the manger</hi> in a ſumptuous chappell, built by <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus quintus,</hi> for that purpoſe) and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes it along the ſtreet in Proceſſion; when behold the celeſtiall Spirits, are heard ecchoing forth the bleſſed Virgins prayſes, in anſwer to their pious hymnes
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:133233:109"/> and Litanies, the ayre is fill'd with the melodious harmonie of angelicall Chori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, in toning ſweet Athems to her honour, and ſaluting her with theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred words, (uſed ever ſince by the Church in the paſchall Office.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Regina coeli laetare;</hi> &amp;c. O Queen of Heaven rejoyce, Alleluja. for he whom you deſerv'd to bear, Alleluja. Is riſen from death as he foretold, Alleluja. To which the holy Pope, by divin inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, added of his own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pray unto God for us, Alleluja.</hi> and an Angell is ſeen upon the top of the Adrian Towr, putting up a Sword into its ſcabbard.</p>
                  <p>The aſtoniſh'd St. <hi>Gregorie,</hi> inferring, from that action, a mitigation of the divine indignation, denounces to the no leſs raviſh'd people, a <hi>Quietus eſt,</hi> from the Court of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And (O admirable prodigy of the divin mercy! O clear teſtimony of holy Maryes Power!) there immediately follow'd a full and happy delivery from that dire diſeaſe and mortalitie.</p>
                  <p>And is not this onely miracle, (wrought in the open view of the world, done in the head-Citie of the Univerſe, acted (as to that part of it which is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:133233:110"/> cavill'd at,) by the Churches chief Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, and Chriſts vice-gerent upon earth, and regiſtred by ſo many undeniable and authentick authors) able to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found you;</hi> O Heretiques and Image-haters! capable to <hi>convert</hi> you: O half-Catholiques, and diſhonourers of holy <hi>Mary!</hi> ſufficient to <hi>comfort</hi> you: O de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout children of the ſacred Roſary! yet caſt an eye upon ſome others of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the ſucceedding ages.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Stephen</hi> the third, making a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion on his bare feet, together with the Roman Clergie and people, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a holy Image on his own ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the ſame Church of St. <hi>Marie at the Manger,</hi> implor'd and obtain'd the like heavenly aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sergius</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> carryed the ſacred Virgins Image in proceſſion about the Citie-walls, and receiv'd a preſent and miraculous reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die againſt <hi>Caganus,</hi> and the reſt of the Scithians, his beſieging enemies.</p>
                  <p>The ſame was done under <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour in his Perſian expedition who thereupon obtain'd a compleat vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over his enemies, deſtroying (with the loſs only of fifty of his own Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) the two vaſt Armies of Duke

                     <hi>Razates,</hi> whoſe golden Armour he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards hung up as a trophe to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Virgin.</p>
                  <p>And when the ſame Citie of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> was again ſtraightned by the cruell <hi>Saracens,</hi> the diſtreſſed Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants making their accuſtomed addreſſes to their Powerfull Patroneſs, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſacred <hi>Effigies,</hi> as formerly about their beſieged walls, ſaw their Enemies ſuddenly periſhing before their faces: ſome with fire from Heaven, the reſt with famin, peſtilence, ſhipwrack, and ſuch like ſevere puniſhments: In memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of which miraculous delivery the gratefull Citizens celebrated an annuall Feſtivity in <hi>her</hi> honour, by <hi>whoſe</hi> help they obtain'd it.</p>
                  <p>Many more examples might be here multiply'd: in <hi>Constantin</hi> the laſt Eaſtern Emperour, <hi>Emmanuel</hi> the Conquerour of <hi>Pannonia, Joannes Ximiſca</hi> the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comer of the Ruſſians, <hi>Joannes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius</hi> the Triumpher over the Perſians. &amp;c. But theſe few are more than ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to vindicate this our pious cuſtom, not only from Innovation, but from all other aſperſions whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Ceremonie in theſe our Proceſſions is the carryage of <hi>wax-Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,</hi>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:133233:111"/> or <hi>Torches,</hi> in imitation, of the Churches ancient cuſtom, obſerv'd upon the day of the bleſſed Virgins Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: of which our St <hi>Bede</hi> ſaid long ſince: <hi>This good cuſtom ſpeading it ſelf abroad, was kept alſo in the other Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivities of the ſacred Mother, and Virgin Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fifth and laſt Ceremonie is the ſinging or reciting of the Litanies of our bleſſed Lady of the <hi>Roſary:</hi> which Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are ſung in the Church called our Lady of <hi>Minerva</hi> in Rome, and in many other Churches throughout all Italie upon every Saturday, by the approbation and authoritie of Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the thirteenth in his Brief bearing date, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill</hi> the fifteenth 1580. which Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>This way of honouring the divin Majeſty, and the ſacred Virgin-Mother, by a certain number of our Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Angelical Salutations, hath been variouſly practiſed by the ancient Fathers, and deſcribed under ſeverall names and notions; whereof ſome call'd it the bleſſed Virgins <hi>Epithalamium,</hi> her <hi>Canticle,</hi> her <hi>Crown,</hi> her Roſie <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> her ſacred <hi>Quinquagena.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others relating to the number of the ſalutations therein contained, call'd it the Virgins Pſalter in imitation of the Pſalter of <hi>David,</hi> conſiſting of the ſame number of Pſalms, or alluding to that Muſical Inſtrument (which the Hebrews nam'd <hi>Nahalum,</hi> the Greeks <hi>Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and we a <hi>Pſalterium</hi>) compos'd of an hundred and fifty Pipes, (the juſt number of theſe our ſalutations:)
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:133233:131"/> whereupon the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> were uſually ſung to the divin prayſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>Others finaly call'd it by the now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly receiv'd denomination of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> &amp; that moſt properly; For as a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſignifies literally a place beſet with Odoriferous Roſes; So this our <hi>Roſary</hi> betokens myſticaly the ſweet fragrancie which repleniſhes their hearts and ſouls, who thus devoutly prayſe the divin Majeſty, and honour the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having explicated its Name, let's paſs on to its Antiquity: which undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, as to its <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is of equall ſtanding with the ſacred Goſpell; Since the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Angelicall Salutation</hi> (the materiall parts of our <hi>Roſary,</hi>) are the very Evangelicall words and ſentences: And as to its <hi>uſe,</hi> is alſo of equall antiquitie with our primitive Chriſtianity, ſince (according to the generall <hi>Maxim</hi> of our School-Divines) <hi>When in Eccleſiaſticall matters by the Church Univerſally embrac'd, no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty can be found of their firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they must be believed to have proceeded from the Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which mov'd the learned <hi>Aquenſis,</hi> to write thus to <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:133233:132"/> This pious cuſtom of ſaluting the ſacred Virgin, cannot be ſaid to be any Novell invention, but may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd to be as ancient as the Church it ſelf; For when at the beginning, the Prieſts and Eccleſiaſticall perſons, being full of Zeal and Fervour, recited dayly all the verſes of the Davidicall Pſalter, (comprehending thrice fifty Pſalms) ſo employing the greateſt part of their time in the divin praiſes: The devout Laity, (though much inferiour to them in point of learning and knowledg, yet deſirous to equall them in Gods love and ſervice:) emulating this laudable cuſtom, (but ſome of them being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to read, others uncapable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe ſacred Pſalms) invented and dayly recited a certain Pſalter (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the myſticall number of the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidical Pſalms) of the Lords Prayer, and Angelicall ſalutation an hundred and fifty times repeated; piouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving (as well they might) that all the ſacred myſteries of thoſe many Pſalm's were compendiouſly contain'd in this ſingular Prayer and Salutation, ſince they declar'd him to be now come and preſent, <hi>whom</hi> thoſe Pſalms had foretold and promis'd.</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:133233:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Which devotion of the Primitive Chriſtians, will not ſeem any wonder to ſuch as duely conſider their great fervour and piety in other ſpirituall exerciſes: as may be inſtanced, in that the whol ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the lay-people receiv'd then <hi>dayly the ſacred Eucharist.</hi> Surely a moſt convenient way to lay that firſt foundation of a new Church upon ſolid devotion and ſanctity, which was to ſuſtain afterwards ſo weightie a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure.</p>
                  <p>But when in the following ages (the number of Chriſtians encreaſing and the fervour of piety decaying) this kind of Pſalter became burthenſome to the multitude of Chriſtians (who were now more attentive to their domeſtick and temporall negotiations, than zealous of the divin ſervice) it was abridg'd into an hundred and fifty Angelical ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; keeping ſtill the ſame myſtical number, but changing its denomination into that of the bleſſed Virgins Pſalter; and interlacing each Decade, with the recitall of our Lords Prayer, in imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Clergie, ſo performing their Church Pſalmodie.</p>
                  <p>This was that <hi>Pſalter,</hi> ſo much prays'd and practis'd by the Egyptian Hermits
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:133233:133"/> and Anchorits, to which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as to their preſent ſolace in all their preſſing ſadneſſes and afflictions, their powerfull Remedie againſt all thier troubles and temptations, their ſecure Sanctuary in all their ſpirituall conflicts and combats.</p>
                  <p>This manner of Prayer was alſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented and practis'd (not onely as to its <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> which are the Lords Prayer and Angelical ſalutation; but alſo as to its forenam'd <hi>Quantity</hi> and <hi>Qual'ty</hi> by the holy Fathers and Doctors of the Church; Witneſs St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> of whom it is related in the Eccleſiaſtical hiſtories, That he plac'd an undoubted hope in the ſuffrages of this <hi>Pſalter</hi> againſt all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, troubles and afflictions whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and eſpecially againſt the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Chriſtian Faith: nor would he ever ſettle himſelf (ſay's <hi>Foſſaeus lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Pſalterio</hi>) to any ſerious reading, writing, or dictating, till he had firſt implor'd the divin aſſiſtance by the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of this Pſalter</p>
                  <p>Neither muſt we omit (ſay's <hi>Alanus de Rupe</hi>) to make mention of that moſt worthy Patriark of Monks, St. <hi>Bennet:</hi> who choſe this Pſalter for his familiar and perpetuall companion, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:133233:133"/> to become the famous founder of Monaſtical Inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Which propagation of the <hi>Marian Pſalter</hi> (ſay's <hi>Bucelinus in his Meno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logium, March</hi> 21.) is none of the leaſt of St. <hi>Bennets</hi> prayſes; the Queen of Heaven her ſelf highly approving and commending the ſame, endowing <hi>her Bennet</hi> (for ſo ſhe was heard to name him) with many ſignall favours, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and bleſſings, and choſing the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries of his ſacred Order (as it were) for her earthly ſeat and manſion even to this day.</p>
                  <p>And in the Benedictin Annals, (<hi>anno</hi> 538.) we find regiſtred, that though St. <hi>Bennet</hi> from his very infancy, and in the beginning of his converſion, when he laid the firſt plat-form of monaſtical Perfection, was ſingularly devoted to the Empreſs of Heaven, and a great Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of her Honour, Name, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; Yet chiefly about this time (to wit, the <hi>59th.</hi> year of his age) he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated in the head City, and to the whol World, that ſweet, eaſy, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious exerciſe of the bleſſed Virgins Pſalter, which himſelf with his Diſciples had ſo piouſly and profitably practis'd within the private Cloyſters of <hi>Sublake</hi>

                  <p>Hence it is, that the whol Quire of his ſucceeding Monks, imitating the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſo glorious a Father, became ever ſince moſt zealous practitioners and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of the ſame piety and devotion: and to the end it might be perpetuated to all their poſterity, they prudently ſet apart one day of the year, in which they make a particular Commemoration of the ſacred <hi>Pſalter,</hi> thus inſtituted by their Patriarch St. <hi>Bennet:</hi> to wit, the 18. of <hi>June,</hi> where their Martyrologe ſay's thus.

                  <p>Thus (moſt devout Roſariſts!) you have the Virginall <hi>Pſalter,</hi> briefly brought down to St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> who not only reviv'd its decayed uſe, but is undoubtedly the Author of the Roſary, (as to the particular method and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wherein we now recite it) and who is the Beginner of this ſacred Confrater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie whereof we are members, as appears by the Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> (whoſe laſt words we ſhall only here produce to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void unneceſſary prolixity in a matter of ſo great certainty.)</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Creed</hi> (wherewith we begin and

Surely the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I then felt, exceeds all expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:133233:150"/> of all internall Prayer) are much more eaſily experienced, than explicated: And alſo, ſince this is largly deliver'd by ſeverall learned Authors, upon the ſubject of Mentall Prayer and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we ſhall only here give you (moſt devout Roſariſts!) ſome few rules and cautions, whereby you may underſtand how to manage theſe your <hi>Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> for your beſt ſpirituall profit, and advantage.</p>
                  <p>Whoſoever therefore will fruitfully meditate upon the <hi>Joyfull,</hi> and <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Myſteries of the Roſary:</p>

                  <p>WE have hitherto (in our firſt Book) prepared you (O pious Children of <hi>Mary!</hi>) with ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Inſtructions, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and brought you (as it were) with your Bedes in hand, ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite your <hi>Roſary.</hi>

                  <p>Now ſince the <hi>Roſary,</hi> is begun and ended with [1.] the <hi>Sign of the Croſs,</hi> and [2.] ſaying of the <hi>Creed;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts [3.] in the frequent Repetition of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and [4.] <hi>Angelicall Salutation;</hi> and [5.] in the continuall <hi>Meditation</hi> upon the chief Myſteries of our Redeemer and his ſacred Mother: you are firſt to ground your ſelves in the knowledge and underſtanding (at leaſt in ſome meaſure) of theſe Prayers, and of theſe Myſteries; that ſo your devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may prove more efficacious, and your Prayers be perform'd with more guſt and ſatisfaction.</p>

                  <p>With this <hi>ſign</hi> all faithfull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought to begin all their actions (according to that Counſell and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of S. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> Make this <hi>ſign</hi> both eating and drinking; and ſitting and ſtanding; and ſpeaking and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: And of S. <hi>Hierome:</hi> At every action, and upon all occaſions, let the hand imprint a <hi>Croſs</hi>): But much more carefull ſhould they be, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their prayers &amp; devotions, (which are the chief Acts of Religion) with
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:133233:155"/> this ſacred <hi>ſign;</hi> Amd moſt of all, ought they ſo to begin the recitall of their <hi>Roſary,</hi> which (as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the precedent Oration) is the moſt eminent ſort of prayer and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> alleadges ſeverall Reaſons for this generall cuſtom of all Chriſtians: Becauſe this <hi>ſign</hi> of the Croſs (ſays he) directs the courſe of our Pilgrimage, inſtructs us for our combat, helps us in our conflict, ſtrengthens us for our Conqueſt; It deſtroys all dangers, and defends us from all Diabolicall ſubtilties and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations. To which may be added,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this ſign of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> is a compendious Profeſſion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, wherein the Myſtery of the ſacred Trinity, the Incarnation, and Paſſion of our Bleſſed Saviour, and the Remiſſion of ſins by his merits is briefly taught and declared.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a certain badge, by which Orthodox Chriſtians are known and diſtinguiſh'd from Sectaries and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells: we are all ſaid to be Chriſtians, (ſays S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>) for we are all ſign'd with Chriſts ſignet.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is an Invocation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:133233:156"/> aſſiſtance in all our actions, for by this <hi>ſign</hi> we invoke the ſacred Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to our ayd, by the mediation of our Saviours Paſſion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It affords us ſpirituall comfort and courage; For if thou art not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd (ſays S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>) to make this ſign exteriourly before men; thou mayſt confidently expect to feel the divin ſweetneſs in thy Soul.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is a Meditation, and Imitation of our Redemers paſſion. When thou ſigneſt thy ſelf with the <hi>Croſs,</hi> (ſays S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>) ruminate in thy mind the whol cauſe of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and thou ſhalt eaſily quench the fires of all thy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It gives us hopes of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For what may not <hi>he</hi> hope, <hi>who</hi> beholds Chriſt dying on the Croſs for his Redemption; and <hi>who</hi> looks upon Chriſt more faithfully, than <hi>he,</hi> who frequently imprints his <hi>Croſs</hi> upon his heart and forehead? to which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle alluding, exhorts all Chriſtians to remember, at <hi>how dear a rate they are bought,</hi> and to glorifie and carry God in their Bodyes.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It inflames our ſouls in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin love and charity. For who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:133233:156"/> Chriſt expiring on the <hi>Croſs</hi> for his ſake, and continue cold and tepid? God commends his love towards us (ſay's the Apoſtle), <hi>In that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt dyed for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. It a verts from us Gods indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and revenge: In which ſenſe, that ſaying of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> is underſtood by S. <hi>Gregory of Nice,</hi> and by S. <hi>Hierom. Thou</hi> (O Lord!) <hi>haſt given a ſign to them that fear thee, that they may fly from before the Bow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. It defends us from all our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes: ſo the ſame Fathers explicate that other paſſage of the Pſalmiſt; ſhew ſome <hi>ſign</hi> upon me for good, that they who hate me, may ſee it, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd, becauſe thou (O Lord) haſt holpen me, and comforted me.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. It drives away the Devills. Sign thy ſelf (ſays S. <hi>Cyril</hi>) with the <hi>Croſs</hi> in the forehead; that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill perceiving the Kings character, may be affrighted and fly from thee: And again, This <hi>ſign</hi> (ſays he) is a comfort to Chriſtians, and a terrour to the Devills: And the Martyr <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius:</hi> The ſign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> is a Trophe againſt the power of the Prince of this world, which hearing and beholding, he fears and trembles.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Finally,</hi> The ſign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> (ſays S. <hi>Cyrill</hi>) is the Seminary of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: and in it alone (ſays S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) conſiſts the proſperity of all Chriſtians.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Firſt Rule</hi> (which concerns the action of your underſtanding) is, <hi>To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent before the Eyes of your Soul that myſterie, whereon you are to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, as even then acted in your preſence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for Example, The myſterie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon you intend to make your meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is, <hi>The Nativity of our Saviour:</hi> Imagin your ſelf ſtanding in a privat cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the poor <hi>Bethleem</hi> Stable, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hearing, and admiring all that there
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:133233:182"/> paſſed in that ſacred night: run over in your mind the condition of the place, and the circumſtances of the <hi>Perſons,</hi> and think what were their <hi>thoughts,</hi> affections, words, actions: above all conſider <hi>who it was,</hi> that appeared to the World in this mean equipage: to wit, the Son of God, the King of Glory, the Monark of the whol Univerſe: then pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his love to mankind in generall, and to your ſelf in particular, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſecond Rule</hi> (which concerns the action of your will) is, <hi>That you paſs ſpeedily from ſpeculative diſcourſes to devout affections, and ſelf-reflections,</hi> as for example, had you been in the Bethleem ſtable aforeſaid, how diligently would you have employ'd your ſelf in the ſervice of little <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and his loving <hi>Mother?</hi> How willingly would you have pick'd up ſticks, made a fire, ayr'd his ſwaths, and fetch'd or carryed what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever might have been uſefull for their ſolace and ſuccour, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Such like reflections will rayſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd deſires, and firm reſolutions in your ſoul of better loving and ſerving both the Son and Mother for the future, and of ſuffering for his ſake, who ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo much for yours, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>And in ſome ſuch manner you may conclude each <hi>myſterie</hi> by ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reſolution (drawn from the ſubject of the <hi>meditation</hi>) either of correcting ſuch an imperfection, or of exerciſing ſuch a vertu: and aſſure your ſelf, that if you preſently apply your ſelf to the practiſe of ſuch well made reſolutions (humbly imploring the divin aſſiſtance therein by the bleſſed Virgins Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:) you ſhall find it a moſt ſpeedy and efficacious means to the amendment of your life, the extirpation of vice, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting of vertu; and finally much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to your generall advancement in all ſorts of ſpirituall Perfections.</p>

                              <hi>ſorrows</hi> from your heart: Hear him ſpeaking unto you in his wonted tone and tearms of reſpect: All Hail, my moſt honoured Mother! Peace and joy be with you: 'Tis I my ſelf who am the comfortable Meſſenger of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py exchange of yours and my ſorrows into gladneſs and Jubilation; both, that you may with me inceſſantly prayſe and bleſs my Eternall Father; and alſo, that you may take the firſt and beſt ſhare of <hi>joy,</hi> who have the greateſt intereſt in me, and had the greateſt part with me in my paſſion of any mortall creature.</p>
                           <p>See and admire the power of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightyes right hand, in the perſon of your Son: The diſgrac'd is glorifi'd; the defam'd is juſtifi'd; the condemn'd is abſolv'd, the crucifi'd is reſuſcitated! Rejoyce then, dear Mother! together with you joyfull Son; for whom you need not now fear any further miſeries, perſecutions, Croſſes; ſince he is above the reach of mans malice, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils power, having put on the robes of glory, impaſſibility, immortality. The ſhort <hi>Winter</hi> of ſuffering is turn'd into a perpetuall <hi>Summer</hi> of conſolation; The ſtormy ſhowers of <hi>blood,</hi> into a
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:133233:246"/> ſweet dew of <hi>bleſſings:</hi> All my <hi>wounds</hi> are perfectly cur'd, and the <hi>ſcarrs</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remain, as <hi>Rubies</hi> of my honour, and <hi>badges</hi> of my victory.</p>
                           <p>O the exceſſes of <hi>Joy,</hi> which tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported your extaſi'd heart and ſoul, O ſacred Virgin-Mother! at the ſight of your now again living, and gloriouſly triumphing Son <hi>Jeſus!</hi> And, O my ſoul! If thou deſireſt a ſhare in theſe Joys and gloryes of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> thou muſt alſo reſolve to bear a part in their ſorrows and ſufferings: Thou art much miſtaken, in thinking to triumph without trying for the Victory, or to be crown'd without conquering.</p>
                           <p>No, my delicate <hi>Soldier!</hi> Chriſt thy King and Captain ſuffer'd before he entred into his glory: Queen <hi>Maries</hi> heart was pierced with ſorrow, before it was repleniſh'd with comforts. All the Saints combated, before they were crown'd: And refuſeſt thou all ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, all ſorrows, all combates, all that thy fleſh and blood cannot reliſh?</p>
                           <p>O dear Jeſu! What will you do with me, who dare not encounter with the leaſt difficulties? How will you deal with me, who bear the name of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſoldier, and am indeed no better
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:133233:247"/> than a baſe and cowardly ſenſualiſt?</p>
                           <p>If I love the glory of your <hi>Crown,</hi> why diſlike I the ignominie of your <hi>Croſs?</hi> If I deſire the reward of a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror;</hi> why do I not adventure into the field of the <hi>combat?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>O why ſhould your painfull <hi>death</hi> and paſſion ſo much affright me; ſince your glorious <hi>Reſurrection</hi> confirms me in the Hope and Faith of a future feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city? why ſhould I more dread, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the difficulties occurring in my <hi>Pilgrimage:</hi> than rejoyce, in fixing my thoughts upon the pleaſures of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> which is the end of my <hi>Pilgrimage?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>O why am I not content to ſuffer with <hi>Jeſus</hi> and for <hi>Jeſus,</hi> were there no reward to be expected for all my ſufferings! It being a ſufficient glory to a faithfull Chriſtian, to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to Chriſt his Captain.</p>
                           <p>Behold therefore: I humbly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate my ſelf here at your ſacred feet, O my victorious Redeemer! imploring your pardon for my paſt puſillanimity, and purpoſing to behave my ſelf here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after more manfully.</p>
                           <p>Come all ſorts of croſſes and loſſes; all ſorrows and ſickneſſes, all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

I will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſs <hi>through</hi> them couragiouſly, or paſs <hi>by</hi> them patiently, or paſs <hi>over</hi> them victoriouſly.</p>
                           <p>Yes, (my Lord Jeſu!) I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive henceforth all afflictions from the hands of your divin providence, as pledges of your paternall affection; and moſt willingly, joyfully, reſignedly embrace them, as the happily offered occaſions for the encreaſe of my merit, the exerciſe of my vertu, the perfection of my ſoul, the expiation of my ſins, the crowning me with glory.</p>

                  <p>THE many Excellencies, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and Prerogatives of Saint
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:133233:331"/> 
                     <hi>Joſeph,</hi> are largely deduced by ſeverall <hi>Learned Writers:</hi> Out of <hi>Whom,</hi> theſe few following are ſelected, wherupon to ground our Devotion to this great Saint; and to lay a foundation for the enſuing affective Acts, and Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> was ſanctifi'd in his Mothers womb: Which favour ſeems (in ſome ſort) due to <hi>him, who</hi> was to have ſo neer a relation to the Word Incarnate, (the Source and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of all ſanctity) and <hi>who</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd from all Eternity, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave of the Adorable Trinity, to be the Preſident of Gods great Councill of State upon Earth, the Angell Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the Queen of Angells, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Father, and the reall Foſterer, Nurſer, Conductor, and Governor of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> the worlds <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the Head of his holy Family. Now ſince Gods Family conſiſted only of two Perſons, <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> who were of more worth and dignity, than all the reſt of Heavenly and Earthly Creatures together; it was convenient that <hi>He,</hi> who was to govern them, ſhould alſo reſemble them in Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Dignity, and Sanctity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:133233:332"/> that he ſhould poſſeſs in ſome meaſure (by an anticipated par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his Originall ſin, and by an advanced favour of ſanctifying Grace) <hi>that Puritie</hi> which the <hi>Son</hi> poſſeſſed by Nature, and the <hi>Mother</hi> by Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He was the next after the ſacred Virgin, who made an expreſs Vow and promiſe to God of Perpetuall virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And this Reſolution, Intention, and Promiſe both of <hi>Her,</hi> and <hi>Him,</hi> was reveal'd to each other reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and renewed by them jointly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were contracted together by formall Matrimony. For how els could Bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> (who had oblig'd her ſelf to virginall Integrity) have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented (either in Prudence or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice) to give the Power over her body to a perſon, of whoſe Chaſtity ſhe might be ignorant, or doubtfull of his Conſtancie? Surely, the known Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of her Chaſt <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> gave her the confidence to treat and converſe with him, as ſecurely as ſhe did with the holy Seraphins.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He no ſooner perceiv'd his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spouſe to be bigg with child, but he caſt about how he might handſomly
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:133233:332"/> retreat from her company: not as har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring the leaſt doubt or diſtruſt of her Innocency, (being more certain of her Inviſible Chaſtity, than of her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible appearing to be with child; and knowing that it was more eaſy for a Virgin to conceive, than for <hi>Mary</hi> to deceive him, or diſtain her own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour): But out of a deep and humble ſenſe of his due reſpect towards her Son and her ſelf; as judging himſelf alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unworthy to contemplate with his eyes, and carry in his arms the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin Word Incarnate, and to converſe intimately and familiarly with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Mother of this God Man, who was ſhorthly after to be born into the World.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He govern'd Gods Family for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty years ſpace. As the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin Providence hath eſtabliſh'd <hi>three</hi> Orders in the World; That of <hi>Nature,</hi> that of <hi>Grace,</hi> and that of <hi>Hypoſtaticall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion:</hi> So he hath choſen and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted three ſorts of ſervants for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and government of theſe Orders. The <hi>Angells</hi> ſerve him in the order of Nature; the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the order of Grace; but he choſe <hi>S. Joſeph</hi> alone, (after the ſacred Virgin) to ſerve him
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:133233:333"/> in the third Order, which is that of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> in the ineffable Myſterie of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation. O the Excellency, the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, the Greatneſs of Saint <hi>Joſeph!</hi> O his honour and happyneſs, to enjoy ſo long the Innocent embraces of <hi>Jeſus in his Childhood!</hi> The holy En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments of <hi>Jeſus in his riper years!</hi> The divin actions, examples, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of <hi>Jeſus in his perfect age!</hi> And to live ſo long in company and converſation with the moſt holy and accompliſh'd Princeſs that ever was!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He (together with his ſacred Spouſe) circumcis'd <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in the Stable of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> eight day's after his Birth into the world; and (according to the divin Order and command, which was ſignifi'd unto him by an Angelicall Meſſenger) impos'd upon him that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious name of JESUS.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He nouriſh'd, fed, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd <hi>Him,</hi> with the ſweat of his brows, and labour of his hands; <hi>who,</hi> affords food and ſuſtenance to all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures. And cloathed <hi>him,</hi> who furniſhed the Lillyes, Roſes, and flowers of the Field, with all their beautifull Robes and Ornaments.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He was (in ſome ſort) the <hi>ſaver</hi>
                     <pb n="593" facs="tcp:133233:333"/> of his <hi>Saviour,</hi> by ſheltring little <hi>Jeſus</hi> from <hi>Herods</hi> rage and crueltie, and ſtepping aſide with him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> whilſt the Innocents, bought the palm of Martyrdom with the price of their blood.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. He commanded <hi>him,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all earthly Princes and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs; and had <hi>him</hi> obedient to the beck of his hand, to the nod of his head, to the twinkle of his eye, and to the ſound of his voyce, before whom the Powers of Heaven fall down and tremble.

                  <p n="9">9.
